## Processors Configuration

Draco contains a set of processors for storing context data like NGSI events. This document is intended to show, how to
configure the NGSI processor listed above:

-   Listen_HTTP (configured as source for receiving notifications from Orion Context Broker)
-   NGSIToMySQL (for storing NGSI events into MySQL Database)
-   NGSIToPostgreSQL (for storing NGSI events into PostgreSQL Database)
-   NGSIToMongo (for storing NGSI events into Mongo Database)

### Listen_HTTP Processor

Fist, we need to have Draco up and running. Then you need to follow the steps to add a new processor showed in the
[Draco GUI](../installation_and_administration_guide/draco_gui.md) section.

Once you are in the add processor window, write inside of the filter box "Http" in order to filter the processors by
that keyword and select the "ListenHTTP" processor.

The Listen HTTP processor starts an HTTP Server and listens on a given base path to transform incoming requests into
FlowFiles. The default URI of the Service will be `http://{hostname}:{port}/v2/notify`. Only HEAD and POST requests are
supported. GET, PUT, and DELETE will result in an error and the HTTP response status code 405. We use this NiFi native
processor for receiving the HTTP notifications coming from Orion Context Broker.

The configuration needed for this processor is showed in the figure above.

### NGSIToMySQL Processor

The NGSIToMySQL processor takes the FLowFile generated by the ListenHTTP processor and transforms it into an NGSI event.
After, this processor is going to communicate with the DBCPConnectionPoll controller service (previously set in the
processor's properties). Finally, the processor, using the controller features, creates the database, the tables and
insert the data into the MySQL database using the structure defined by the NGSI standard.

| Rollback on failure   | false         | true, false      | Specify how to handle error. By default (false), if an error occurs while processing a FlowFile, the FlowFile will be routed to 'failure' or 'retry' relationship based on error type, and processor can continue with next FlowFile. Instead, you may want to rollback currently processed FlowFiles and stop further processing immediately. In that case, you can do so by enabling this 'Rollback On Failure' property. If enabled, failed FlowFiles will stay in the input relationship without penalizing it and being processed repeatedly until it gets processed successfully or removed by other means. It is important to set adequate 'Yield Duration' to avoid retrying too frequently. |

### NGSIToPostgreSQL Processor

The NGSIToPostgreSQL processor takes the FLowFile generated by the ListenHTTP processor and transforms it into an NGSI
event. After, this processor is going to communicate with the DBCPConnectionPoll controller service (previously set in
the processor's properties). Finally, the processor, using the controller features, creates the database, the tables and
insert the data into the PostgreSQL database using the structure defined by the NGSI standard.

| Rollback on failure   | false         | true, false      | Specify how to handle error. By default (false), if an error occurs while processing a FlowFile, the FlowFile will be routed to 'failure' or 'retry' relationship based on error type, and processor can continue with next FlowFile. Instead, you may want to rollback currently processed FlowFiles and stop further processing immediately. In that case, you can do so by enabling this 'Rollback On Failure' property. If enabled, failed FlowFiles will stay in the input relationship without penalizing it and being processed repeatedly until it gets processed successfully or removed by other means. It is important to set adequate 'Yield Duration' to avoid retrying too frequently. |

### NGSIToMongo Processor

The NGSIToMongo processor takes the FLowFile generated by the ListenHTTP processor and transforms it into an NGSI event.
Finally, the processor, creates the schema, documents and collections with the data into the Mongo database using the
structure defined by the NGSI standard.

Once you have your processors configured, you need to connect the source (Listen HTTP processor) and the sinks
(NGSIToMySQL, NGSIToPostgreSQL, NGSIToMongo ). In the next section we will explain how to establish and configure this
connection.
